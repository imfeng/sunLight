/* You’ll first be prompted to create a password for the keystore. Then, answer the rest of the nice tools’s questions and when it’s all done, you should have a file called my-release-key.keystore created in the current directory.

Note: Make sure to save this file somewhere safe, if you lose it you won’t be able to submit updates to your app!

To sign the unsigned APK, run the jarsigner tool which is also included in the JDK:
*/

# jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore platforms\android\build\outputs\apk\android-release-unsigned.apk alias_name

/* This signs the apk in place. Finally, we need to run the zip align tool to optimize the APK. The zipalign tool can be found in /path/to/Android/sdk/build-tools/VERSION/zipalign. For example, on OS X with Android Studio installed, zipalign is in ~/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/VERSION/zipalign:
*/
# rm release.apk
# "c:\Users\HermitF\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\build-tools\25.0.3\zipalign.exe" -v 4 platforms\android\build\outputs\apk\android-release-unsigned.apk release.apk
